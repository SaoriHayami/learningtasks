  <div class="desc"> THE PORK BARREL SCAM --
      The Priority Development Assistance Fund scam, also known as the PDAF scam or the pork barrel scam, is a political scandal involving the alleged misuse of the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF, popularly known as "pork barrel") by several members of the Philippine Congress. The PDAF is a lump-sum discretionary fund granted to each member of Congress for spending on priority development projects of the Philippine government, mostly on the national level.</div>

  <div class="desc">The Philippine police system is rife with corruption, with the Philippines National Police being one of the most corrupt agencies in the country. Several claims have surfaced of national police officials and military personnel engaging in illegal acts like as extortion, corruption, and involvement in local rackets. Private firms claim that they cannot rely entirely on police assistance, and half of them opt to pay for private protection.
According to CNN Philippines, Police Commissioner Mr. Sombero was being investigated in a corruption case for allegedly facilitating a PHP 50 million bribe from gambling tycoon Jack Lam, who attempted to bribe immigration officials to release approximately 1,300 Chinese nationals who were working illegally in his resorts.</div>

  <div class="desc"> Corruption in the Philippine judicial system is also a major problem. Bribery and irregular payments in return for favourable judicial decisions are quite common. Although judicial officials are independent by law, rich and powerful groups and individuals wield control and influence over the judicial system and influence the outcomes of civil and criminal proceedings. Financial investment dispute often take an unnecessarily long period of time due to staffing shortages, lack of resources, and corruption in the court system. The low salaries of judicial officials help exacerbate the problem of bribery in exchange for favours. The judiciary is also criticised for making non-transparent and biased judicial decisions</div>

  <div class="desc">Rather than being organized around voting for political parties, the Philippine political arena is mostly organized and managed by families or coalitions of families. The padrino system refers to the practice of gaining favor, promotion, or political appointment by family ties (nepotism) or friendship (cronyism), rather than merit. In the Philippines, the padrino system has been the source of several disputes and corruption.</div>
