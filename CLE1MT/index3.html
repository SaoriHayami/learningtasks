        <div class="text">Corrupt voters breed corrupt politicians. To combat corruption, we must begin by eradicating it at its source, namely during elections.
Most of us are aware that vote buying is against the law. However, vote selling is also illegal under the law. Both vote buying and vote selling are forbidden and penalized by Section 261 (a) of Article 22 of the Omnibus Election Code. In other words, not only candidates, supporters, or vote purchasers can be found guilty of an election infraction; voters or vote sellers can also be penalised under the legislation. I understand that it appears hard to arrest and imprison all vote vendors for committing an election felony. There is no prison large enough to house all of the Filipinos who sell their votes during elections. Imagine how many there are. It might be a sizable proportion of the Philippine population! Vote selling may be difficult to establish, and vote sellers may not be imprisoned, but if they become aware that their actions are illegal, they may be punished by their own conscience.Furthermore, vote selling and buying have become a major issue in the Philippines since they are often coordinated from the national to the barangay level. As a result, it would be preferable if the government could eliminate these groups or vote brokers (whether inside or outside the government) that handle the widespread corruption of votes in the Philippines.</div>
